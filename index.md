## Walker Hughes 

My name's Walker and I'm a computational mathematician, economist, and San Francisco dweller. I finished my undergrad in April 2021 where I studied Applied and Computational Math and Economics with a minor in Portuguese. I'm trained in much of the mathematics and statistics that underpin modern machine learning and scientific computing, like optimization methods, sampling methods and computational linear algebra. I like exploring new use cases for these skills though personal projects.   

I currently work as an economic consultant where I use statistics and econometrics to study market efficiency, monopoly power, and total welfare realized by consumers. Below are some projects I've been working on with a couple research papers from my underad interspursed. 

<p>Feel free to check out my resume <a href="./Hughes, Walker.pdf">here</a> or take a look at some of my projects below!</p>
