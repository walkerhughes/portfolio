## About Me 

## testing testing 

Hi, I'm Walker. I'm a computational mathematician, economist, and San Franciscan. I finished my undergrad in April of 2021 where I completed dual majors in Applied and Computational Mathematics and Economics with a minor in Portuguese Studies. I'm trained in much of the mathematics and statistics that underpin data science, machine learning, and scientific computing, like optimization methods, sampling methods, and computational linear algebra. I like exploring new use cases for these skills though personal projects, generally using Python as my go-to language. 

I currently work as an economic consultant where I conduct rigorous economic research to study market efficiency, monopoly power, and various other things. A typical day on the job involves exploring large financial and commerce datasets with SQL, digging in even deeper with R, conducting econometric analyses, and writing up my findings for client-ready exhibits and expert reports used in federal level litigation.

A few other fun facts: 
1. 2.5 years of daily Python use for scientific computing, machine learning, and research projects
2. Worked as a Teaching Assistant for four different courses (Machine Learning for Economists, Econometrics, Intermediate Macroeconomics, and Principles of Economics) 
3. Worked as an Machine Learning Research Assistant to study wildfire perimeter estimation with image segmentation 
4. Currently use R and SQL daily for work projects 

Below are some of my recent projects with a few research papers from my undergrad interspursed.
